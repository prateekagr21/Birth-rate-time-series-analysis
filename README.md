# Birth-rate Analysis !!
## Time Series Analysis of Daily births using FBprophet

## For Solving this Usecase, What I have done is :
- Collected the data and organized it to form a meaningful dataset.
- Checked for null values and took care of it.
- Observed the data to form meaningful insights!
<br><br>
- Did Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
- Used correlations to form a heatmap.
- Visualizations were made by using Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries..

- FbProphet's visualizations were used to make graphs and intutive visuals



## And then I made my model for the Prediction :
- Did Data Preprocessing.


# _What i did with Prophet:_
- Created the model
- Fitted my model
- Expanded the date columns
 
 ## And then,
 - Predicted the scores
 - Plotted the prediction
 - again by using fbprophet,
 - Plotted an Yearly Trend Projection

 AT LAST-<br>
 _The prediction we see through the graph are quite natural, what can i say, using this tool for time series analysis was a fair choice after all !_
